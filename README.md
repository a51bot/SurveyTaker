# SurveyTaker
This started as a little project for my soc101 class.  The goal was to build a web app, so I could take surveys of people and where they were at a bit easier, and upload it to a server for everyone to see.  Its not totally comeplete yet.  

I also didnt really know much about websockets, javascript, nodejs, and html, before this project.  Now I know a tad more ;).
If you see something that you like, clone it and have fun messing with my crap code.
